  abstract	= "The Met Officeâs weather and climate simulation code
		  the Unified Model is used for both operational Numerical
		  Weather Prediction and Climate modelling. The computational
		  performance of the model running on parallel supercomputers
		  is a key consideration. A Krylov sub-space solver is
		  employed to solve the equations of the dynamical core of
		  the model, known as ENDGame. These describe the evolution
		  of the Earthâs atmosphere. Typically, 64-bit precision
		  is used throughout weather and climate applications. This
		  work presents a mixed-precision implementation of the
		  solver, the beneficial effect on run-time and the impact on
		  solver convergence. The complex interplay of errors arising
		  from accumulated round-off in floating-point arithmetic and
		  other numerical effects is discussed. A careful analysis is
		  required. The mixed-precision solver is now employed in the
		  operational forecast to satisfy run-time constraints
		  without compromising the accuracy of the solution."
