abstract = "The Met Officeâs weather and climate simulation code the Unified Model is used for both operational Numerical Weather Prediction and Climate modelling. The computational performance of the model running on parallel supercomputers is a key consideration. A Krylov sub-space solver is employed to solve the equations of the dynamical core of the model, known as ENDGame. These describe the evolution of the Earthâs atmosphere. Typically, 64-bit precision is used throughout weather and climate applications. This work presents a mixed-precision implementation of the solver, the beneficial effect on run-time and the impact on solver convergence. The complex interplay of errors arising from accumulated round-off in floating-point arithmetic and other numerical effects is discussed. A careful analysis is required. The mixed-precision solver is now employed in the operational forecast to satisfy run-time constraints without compromising the accuracy of the solution."
