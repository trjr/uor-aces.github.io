### Biography

I started writing Fortran during my undergraduate degree (Chemistry), when laser safety issues left me office-bound at times. My PhD is is electronic structure theory, and I've done some research in materials science (organic and inorganic crystals, mostly). Now I work for NCAS on atmospheric science codes. Through CMS I do training and infrastructure things, and my development focus is on porting or benchmarking on new architectures, or incorporating new libraries (e.g. for IO performance).
