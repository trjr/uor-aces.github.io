### Biography

I obtained a BSc in Computational Physics from the University of Malta in 2017, after which I enrolled and obtained a Masters in Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate from the University of Reading, UK. I then moved onto a doctoral programme in Computer Science. My Ph.D involved developing and understanding the performance of a lightweight deep learning system used to detect Tropical Cyclones, offline, and in climate model runs. The goal of the work was to provide a system which could be used to identify when and where TCs occurred, so that
for those runs targeting TCs, high-resolution data might only be saved when TCs were present.
My Ph.D was awarded in October 2022.

I am now working at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in the U.S.
