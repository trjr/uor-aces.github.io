### Biography

I obtained a BSc in Computational Physics from the University of Malta in 2017, after which I enrolled and obtained a Masters in Atmosphere, Ocean and Cliamte from the Univeristy of Reading, UK by the end of 2018. I am now researching a lightweight deep learning system to detecting atmospheric features, for example Tropical Cyclones, in climate model runs to save resources by not saving any data that does not have such features present for my PhD in Computer Science. This will also help operational meteorologists analyse data in a more efficient manner.
