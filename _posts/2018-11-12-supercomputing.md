Supercomputing was a great success for ACES.
[Julian](/bio/julian) was organizing the Birds-of-a-feather sessions: The IO-500 and the Virtual Institute for I/O, the HPC Certification Program, and Analyzing I/O.
At the [IO-500](https://www.vi4io.org/io500/bofs/sc18/start) BoF, we released the new list ranking the performance of storage -- the number of submissions has grown more than 2x since June!

Julian spoke on five different events delivering the talks:
[Towards an HPC Certification Program](https://hps.vi4io.org/_media/research/talks/2018/2018-11-12-towards_an_hpc_certification_program.pdf),
[The Virtual Institute for I/O](https://hps.vi4io.org/_media/research/talks/2018/2018-11-14-the_virtual_institute_for_i_o.pdf),
[The HPC Certification Program](https://hps.vi4io.org/_media/research/talks/2018/2018-11-15-the_hpc_certification_program.pdf),
