[Bryan](bio/bryan.html) gave [a talk](http://www.bnlawrence.net/talks/2018/03/data-science/) at the Alan Turing Institute on data sciences for climate and environment covering challenges for, and examples of, using (modern) data science techniques in Environmental Science (of course we have been using data
science forever).  Some issues with hardware and software environment were also  discussed.
