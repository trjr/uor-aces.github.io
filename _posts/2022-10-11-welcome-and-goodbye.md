After a quiet period, a lot happened over the summer. [Todd Jones](/bio/todd) has taken up
a lectureship in [our department](http://reading.ac.uk/computer-science) and will be a core member of the ACES activity. Over the same
period [Daniel Galea](/bio/daniel.md) finished his Ph.D and has moved to a post-doctoral
position in Lawrence Livermore Lab in the U.S.  We'll share more about Todd's interests
and Daniel's new job soon.
