[Bryan](bio/bryan.html) gave a seminar in the Meteorology department on the implications for climate modelling of the upcoming supercomputing diversity. Details (and slides) on his personal blog [here](https://www.bnlawrence.net/talks/2019/03/end-of-climate-modelling/). (The difference from the last seminar was that this one was implications for climate modellers, the last one was implications and opportunities for computer science. Roughly half the content was in common between the two seminars.)
