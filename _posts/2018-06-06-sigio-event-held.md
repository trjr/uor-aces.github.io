[Julian](/bio/julian) held a [workshop](/events/2018-06-06-SIGIO_UK.html) in the department aimed at establishing a UK new special interest group in I/O. With attendees from a range of institutions and companies, it was deemed a success, and future meetings will eventuate. Contact Julian if you are interested in participating next time (or keep an eye on our new [events](/events) page.)
