Last week Bryan attended a two-day [HPC workshop](https://www.esiwace.eu/events/5th-enes-hpc-workshop) in Lecce, Italy, organised by
the [ESiWACE](/projects/esiwace) project under the auspices of the European Network for Earth System modelling ([ENES](https://portal.enes.org/)). This workshop is a biennial event which brings together experts from around the world to
discuss frontier computing issues for weather and climate - the focus this year, as recently, was on progress towards
exascale computing - projects, hardware, models, and methods of developing models.  Bryan organised a panel session on what HPC centres are, and will be, doing to support weather and climate workflows at scale. The abstracts are available at the workshop link above, and the presentations themselves will appear there soon.
