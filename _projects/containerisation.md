We will be investigating the use of Singularity, Shifter, and Docker to support a range of key activities, beginning with simple MPI tests, and progressing to more sophisticated deployment of climate models. Deployment targets include JASMIN-Lotus, JASMIN-cloud, ARCHER, NEXCS, laptops, and the public cloud. Technologies in play include SLURM, MPICH, Vagrant, Ansible, as well as the container management tools.

The initial engineering testing will progress to testing and measuring real scientific workflows.
