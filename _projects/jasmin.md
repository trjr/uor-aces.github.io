description: |
    Managing and analysing petascale data requires dedicated computing systems
    with a specialised software environment. We have provided leadership in the
    development of JASMIN as well as investigating real scientific workflows,
    developing infrastructure software, and understanding how best
    to deploy the necessary hardware and software infrastructure.
